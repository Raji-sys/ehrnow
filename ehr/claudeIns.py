"""
In this implementation, we have the following class-based views:

Receptionist Views:
CreatePatientView: 
    Allows the receptionist to create a new patient and creates a PatientHandover object with the status 'waiting_for_payment'.

ReceptionistDashboardView:
    Displays a list of PatientHandover objects with the status 'waiting_for_clinic_assignment' or 'waiting_for_vital_signs'.

HandleAppointmentView:
    Allows the receptionist to handle a scheduled appointment by creating a PatientHandover object with the status 'waiting_for_payment'.

AssignClinicView:
    Allows the receptionist to assign a clinic to a patient and update the PatientHandover status to 'waiting_for_vital_signs'.

    
Payment Clerk Views:
PaymentView: 
    Allows the payment clerk to process the payment for a patient and update the PatientHandover status to 'waiting_for_vital_signs'.

PaymentClerkDashboardView:
    Displays a list of PatientHandover objects with the status 'waiting_for_payment'.

Doctor Views:
ScheduleAppointmentView: 
    Allows the doctor to schedule an appointment for a patient.

    Note that you'll need to create the corresponding templates (e.g., receptionist_dashboard.html, payment.html, schedule_appointment.html) and customize the views according to your specific requirements.

This implementation covers the core functionality we discussed, including creating new patients, handling appointments, processing payments, assigning clinics, and managing the workflow using the PatientHandover model.

Remember to configure the appropriate URL patterns in your urls.py file and handle user authentication and permissions as needed.

You can further extend this implementation by adding views for the nursing desk, consultation room, and any other functionality required in your electronic health record software.
